// WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE

price = 7.99;
console.log(price);

price = 156.98;
console.log(price);

//the lesson is that to reassign a variable "let" should not be there in the redefining. next example will show that. 

/*let price = 5.99;
console.log(price)*/

//if you remove the comment, you will see the console and debugger will reject this code.
